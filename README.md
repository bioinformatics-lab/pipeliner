## Features   
* Modular directory structure: It is designed to generate automated result directory based on the names of the samples and tools used to process them.
* Platform independent: It is bundled with an anaconda repository which contains pre-compiled tools as well as pre-built environments that can be used directly.   
* Modular architecture: It allows the expert users to customize, modify processes, or add additional tools based on their needs.    
* Automated job parallelization, job recovery, and reproducibility.

## Quickstart
